# PlantShop FullStack E-Commerce Website

Welcome to the PlantShop E-Commerce Website, where you can find your favorite plants. 

This is an ongoing project where I contribute daily by adding new features and functionalities.

This application is built using Angular for the front end and ASP.NET Core for the back end. The data is stored in the SQL Server database. 

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you set up a local copy of the project on your machine.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your machine:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (with npm)
- [Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io/)
- [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download)
- [SQL Server](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/sql-server/sql-server-downloads)

### Clone the Repository

- https://github.com/Kozoloski/E-Commerce-Angular-WebAPI.git
- Open the server side with Visual Studio
- Open the client side with Visual Studio Code
- You can find additional info about the Angular part in the readme file located in the client folder in this Repository

### Database Setup

- Modify the connection string configured in appsettings.json for your database. 
- Change the paths in StoreContextSeed to be aligned with your local machine, or make them relative.
- Add migration and update database.

I will update the readme file with a more detailed version whenever I add new functionalities.
